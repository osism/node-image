# roles

# NOTE: If netbox is not used, nothing needs to be changed here. In
#       this case this inventory is used as before. The hosts are
#       then managed here as normal.
#
#       If netbox is used this file is only used to store the hosts
#       for the initial import into the netbox.
#
#       After the initial import of the inventory in the netbox,
#       the groups in this file can be emptied. The systems are
#       then assigned to their roles via tags in the netbox.

# The "all" group is not used in OSISM. Therefore it is important
# that all nodes are explicitly listed here.
[generic]
st01-mgmt-r01-u30

# Nodes that act as manager (sometimes called deployment node)
# are included in this group.
[manager]
st01-mgmt-r01-u30

# Nodes which are intended for monitoring services belong to
# this group
[monitoring]

# Nodes that serve as controllers, so things like scheduler,
# API or database run there, of the environment.
[control]

# Virtual systems managed by OpenStack Nova are placed on
# nodes in this group.
[compute]

# Network resources managed by OpenStack Neutron, such as
# L3 routers, are placed on these nodes. This group has nothing
# to do with the general network configuration.
[network]

# Nodes that serve as controllers for Ceph, so things like the
# Ceph Monitor service run here.
[ceph-control]

# The storage available in these systems is provided in the
# form of OSDs for Ceph.
[ceph-resource]

[ceph-rgw:children]
ceph-control

# NOTE: These empty groups are only necessary if netbox is used. After
#       the initial import of the hosts these groups can be commented
#       out. The groups above with the initial hosts can be commented.
